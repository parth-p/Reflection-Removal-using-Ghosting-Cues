# Reflection-Removal-using-Ghosting-Cues
This project was done as the course project for the Digital Image Processing course and was mentored by Prof. Ravi Kiran.

Reflection in images is a big problem in photography. In this project, we implement and evaluate one the recent algorithms described in literature that attempt to computationally remove reflections. Multiple images were tested on the algorithm and various test cases have been shown towards the end.
